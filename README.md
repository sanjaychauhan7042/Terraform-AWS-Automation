Terraform AWS Automation

Overview

This project automates the provisioning of AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It includes setting up an S3 bucket for Terraform state storage, configuring IAM roles, and deploying resources like EC2 instances, VPC, security groups, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Features

‚úÖ Terraform State Management: Stores Terraform state files in an S3 bucket for remote management.
‚úÖ IAM Role Configuration: Grants appropriate permissions for managing AWS resources securely.
‚úÖ VPC Setup: Configures networking with public and private subnets.
‚úÖ EC2 Deployment: Provisions instances for compute resources.
‚úÖ ALB Integration: Implements an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic efficiently.

Security Considerations

Sensitive Data Handling: Ensure terraform.tfstate and .tfvars files are ignored using .gitignore.

IAM Best Practices: Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring IAM roles.

State Locking: Use an S3 bucket with DynamoDB for state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.
